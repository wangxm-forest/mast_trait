\subsection*{Predator Satiation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Dispersal mode: Animal-dispersed species may be more likely to mast, or
the mechanisms behind masting could differ depending on dispersal mode.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Seed size:} Among animal-dispersed species, larger-seeded species might be more prone to masting.

\section*{Results for Binary Response Variable}
I ran the phyloglm, including the phylogeny variation.Here I reproted the direct model results in a table:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../output/phyloglmResultsTable.pdf}
\end{figure}

The probability was calculated using the inverse-logit transformation:
\[
\Pr(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\alpha + \beta x)}}.
\]


\subsection{Dispersal mode}
\textbf{Conifers}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Species being abiotic dispersed have an 82\% probability of being strong masting species.
\item Species being biotic dispersed and both have a lower probability (67\% and 61\% respectively), but this difference is not statistically.

\item \textbf{Overall, the model provides no evidence that dispersal mode affects whether a conifer species is strong masting or not.}

\textbf{Angiosperms}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Species being abiotic dispersed have an 32\% probability of being strong masting species.
\item Species being biotic dispersed and both have a higher probability (45\% for both of them), but this difference is not statistically.

I also ran the common glm, using conifer and angiosperm as a fixed effect in the model, and I modified the results for better visualization:\\

\caption{Predicted probability of being a strong masting species across categorical traits (pollination mode, seed dispersal, seed dormancy, mono/dio, and drought tolerance). Significance levels are indicated as follows: ns = not significant; * = p < 0.05.}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Pollination mode is a significant predictor of strong masting with wind-pollinated species have a significantly higher probability of being strong masting species and this pattern is consistent for both angiosperms and conifers.
\item Seed dispersal mode is a significant predictor of strong masting with species with biotic dispersed seeds have a significantly higher probability of being strong masting species and this pattern is consistent for both angiosperms and conifers
\item Reproductive type is a significant predictor of strong masting with monoecious species have a significantly higher probability of being strong masting species and this pattern is consistent for both angiosperms and conifers.
\item Seed dormancy and drought tolerance are not strong predictors of strong masting pattern for our studied species.
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../output/figures/glmCon.pdf}
\caption{Effect sizes (log-odds) of continuous traits (fruit size, leaf longevity, oil content, seed size, and seed weight) on the probability of being a strong masting species. Points represent estimated coefficients, with error bars showing standard errors. Significance levels are indicated as follows: ns = not significant; * = p < 0.05.}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fruit size is a significant predictor of strong masting for conifers, with log-odds of masting increaseing with increasing fruit size.
\item Oil content is a significant predictor of strong masting for conifers, with log-odds of masting increasing with higher oil content.
\item Seed size is a significant predictor of strong masting for conifers, with log-odds of masting increasing with bigger seeds.
\item Seed weight is a significant predictor of strong masting for both angiosperm and conifers, with log-odds of masting increasing with bigger seed weight.
\item Leaf longevity is not a strong predictor of strong masting pattern for either conifer or angiosperm.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Results for Continous Response Variable}
For the continuous response variable, I used the mean mast cycle obtained from Silvics and analyzed the data using PGLS. The results indicate that none of the traits is significantly related to mast cycle for either conifer or angiosperm species. There is no phylogenetic signal detected for any of the conifer traits, whereas weak phylogenetic signal is observed for seed dispersal, seed dormancy, reproductive type, drought tolerance, fruit size, and seed weight among angiosperm traits.
